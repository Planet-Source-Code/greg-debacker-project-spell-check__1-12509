## Project Spell Check


</div>

### Description

Have you ever suffered the pain and embarrassment of a misspelled menu caption? If so, then this is the program for you. I wrote this program to go through the entire project and extract every quoted string and every caption, text, and list property. It also will extract comments if you want. It then stores every thing in a ListView control and runs a spell checker on it. The spell checker comes courtesy of the Word 8 Object, which means you will need MS Word 97 or greater to use it. Even if you don't have access to MS Word you can still review all of the words in the ListView. After the spell checker has been run the results of only those items that have been corrected are output to a log file that can be viewed in a text editor.

The program also gathers a lot of information about the project along the way, like how many lines of code, what objects, references, and DLLs are used, along with some other stuff.
